    "This notebook will be used for TAG operations with the PostgreSQL database's `strava_api` schema. The general flow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user asks a question.\n",
    "2. The intent of the question is identified and the question is routed accordingly.\n",
    "3. In the case of a TAG intent being identified (e.g., a user asking about how many runs they've done in the last month), the LLM will be invoked to generate a SQL query.\n",
    "4. The SQL query is executed and, assuming no errors, the results are fed back into an additional LLM call to generate a response to be sent back to the user.\n",
    "5. The resulting answer is returned to the user."
